            <p>My name is Jordy Caceres. I live in New York City, the city that never truly sleeps, and
                worked
                as a Registered Nurse for different hospitals.<br><br>
                I
                went to City College and have a BS in Biology, and also have a BS in Nursing at NYU. You would
                think I have caught on by now, I'm now fully immersed into web development. I'm excited
                to have begun this career journey as it definitely has been mentally stimulating, with extremely
                rewarding battles that I hope to contribute towards the goals and success of a company.<br><br>
            <p>I have completed a Software Developer Bootcamp at Coding Temple, and through that,
                have developed applications ranging from languages Python, Javascript, and Typescript.
                More
                information on my applications can be found in the projects section.</p>

        <span>My Capstone project gained traction on Course Report. You can see me talk about it on their blog

        <h2>Career Change</h2>

        <p>I began my first real career as a Registered Nurse. I worked in various units, working with a
            diverse
            patient population requiring medical attention, from stable elective surgeries to acute trauma
            events, and have met incredible people from all different backgrounds. I learned many things in
            my
            career, including collaboration, interdisciplinary teamwork, and revision to plans when outcomes
            are
            not effective, much of which I believe can translate to this new career.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="webdev">
        <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
        <p>
            I chose web development for a few reasons. I wasn't sure initally what it entailed. My best friend
            is a software engineer, and I was able to see him grow in his career. We'd compare our lifestyles or
            our days at work, his sounded
            mentally stimulating whereas mine was physically taxing. Knowing I wouldn't be able to continue with
            a poor injury record from weightlifitng, I am grateful for the qualities I have inherited through
            it. Nursing has made me confident in communication and interdisciplinary collaboration, voicing
            suggestions especially through patient advocation, and thinking critically. I felt these could carry
            over beautfilly into a career of software engineering, one that emphasis team cooperation, mental
            stimulation, and thinking on constant improvement. </p>
