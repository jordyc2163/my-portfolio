                    <p>My name is Jordy Caceres. I live in New York City, the city that never truly sleeps, and
                        worked
                        as a Registered Nurse for different hospitals.<br><br>
                        I
                        went to City College and have a BS in Biology, and also have a BS in Nursing at NYU. You would
                        think I have caught on by now, I'm now fully immersed into web development. I'm excited
                        to have begun this career journey as it definitely has been mentally stimulating, with extremely
                        rewarding battles that I hope to contribute towards the goals and success of a company.<br><br>
                    <p>I have completed a Software Developer Bootcamp at Coding Temple, and through that,
                        have developed applications ranging from languages Python, Javascript, Typescript, and Node.js.
                        More
                        information on my applications can be found in the projects section.</p>

                    <li>Activity</li>
                    <p>I enjoy staying active. I would go to the gym when I have time, or when it's nice
                        outside, go
                        for a run. My friends and I like to do activities together and occasoinally I would try
                        soemthing new. A friend fo mine introduced me to indoor rock climbing as a sport and it
                        might be my new favorite!</p>
                    <li>Gaming</li>
                    <p>I joke with my friends a lot whenever we're losing a match saying "I don't play to have
                        fun,
                        I play to win." Sarcastically, it holds a bit of truth. I enjoy playing when a title
                        catches
                        me like a great book, and when it does I will usually be caught up for many hours to
                        come. I
                        can be very competitive and try to push myself one further in difficulty, as those
                        endevours
                        are truly rewarding. Otherwise, I hang back with my friends, enjoy casual games, and
                        continue to yell that I'm here to win.</p>
                    <li>Food</li>
                    <p>Cooking has been one thing I did not know would interest me so much. From watching
                        cooking
                        channels to now trying out new recipes, I can say I find satisfaction in when my food
                        looks
                        presentable and delicious. Always looking to expand my repitoire of meals.</p>

                <p>I began my first real career as a Registered Nurse. I worked in various units, working with a
                    diverse
                    patient population requiring medical attention, from stable elective surgeries to acute trauma
                    events, and have met incredible people from all different backgrounds. I learned many things in
                    my
                    career, including collaboration, interdisciplinary teamwork, and revision to plans when outcomes
                    are
                    not effective, much of which I believe can translate to this new career.</p>

            <div class="webdev">
                <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose web development for a few reasons. I wasn't sure initally what it entailed. My best friend
                    is a software engineer, and I was able to see him grow in his career. We'd compare our lifestyles or
                    our days at work, his sounded
                    mentally stimulating whereas mine was physically taxing. Knowing I wouldn't be able to continue with
                    a poor injury record from weightlifitng, I am grateful for the qualities I have inherited through
                    it. Nursing has made me confident in communication and interdisciplinary collaboration, voicing
                    suggestions especially through patient advocation, and thinking critically. I felt these could carry
                    over beautfilly into a career of software engineering, one that emphasis team cooperation, mental
                    stimulation, and thinking on constant improvement. </p>
